This project’s purpose is to allow the user to explore a night sky and trace their own constellations. While the main expected result is entertainment and fun, I think it’s interesting to explore how we find recognizable patterns in millions of objects. Most people nowadays, including myself, don’t often have access to the night sky due to light pollution, and may not have the chance to see the sky clearly at night, and find/recognize constellations and stars. 
One of my fondest childhood memory was stargazing while on a camping trip, and wondering how people noticed these patterns in the first place, then how were they inspired to associate them with certain objects. 
Historically, these patterns been used as navigation guides, as a tool for predictions, and as part of stories (ie Greek Mythology). This project explores what constellations would look like if purpose wasn’t a factor in their conception.
In this program, the stars and planets are placed randomly upon starting it, allowing for a different world every time it is used. However, it also allows the user to document the current world through taking pictures of the canvas.
Since users are able to name planets and constellations without prior knowledge, mythology, or anything, the creation and documentation of where things are in this new world is condensed to a few minutes, which makes for interesting results.
I know people will try to connect stars to create memes and other modern objects and concepts, which answers the question: What if people from this time and place were in charge of creating these patterns?
